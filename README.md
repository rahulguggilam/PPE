# PPE Detection Project README
  - Project Overview
      -  This project aims to develop a PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) detection system using two different approaches:

      - DETR-ResNet: A detection model based on the DETR (DEtection TRansformer) architecture and ResNet backbone.
      - YOLOv5: A real-time object detection system based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm.
